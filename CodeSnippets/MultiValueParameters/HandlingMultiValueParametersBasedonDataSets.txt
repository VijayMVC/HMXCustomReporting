Observations on Handling Multi-Value Input Parameters:

You can use the following syntax in your HMX.rdl to filter by selected values in a select box control.

WHERE xxxx IN (@MultiValueParameter)

PLEASE NOTE that this will NOT work in the BIDS environment.


If you need to show selected values on the report.  Set a Placeholder to use an Expression: =Join(Parameters!MultiValueParameter.Value, ",")
