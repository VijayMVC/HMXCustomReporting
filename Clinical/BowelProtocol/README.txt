This report is used to break out In-house residents who have not had a bowel movement as 
indicated by the bowel monitor touch screen question (190187).  Residents are broken by 3 levels,
8-10 shifts without BM, 11-13 shifts, and 14+ shifts.

In-House date on the report is the either date of admission or last date of return from LOA,
whichever is most recent.  

IMPORTANT: If you don't want new admissions or recent returns from LOA showing up on this list, 
clinicians should enter a late-entry Bowel Monitor assessment with thedate/time of the last BM 
in the hospital or prior to admission
          
NOTE: Times are setup using EST time zone.  Shift ranges are 6-2, 2-10, 10-6.  The assessments store
actual times in UTC so my script corrects it for EST (+4 HH).
