HMXCustomReporting
==================

A repo to share SQL and RDLs for custom reporiting in HealthMEDX

Please add your own -- a folder for each report.  SQL can either be added as a separate file or contained in the 
<CommandText> of the xxxHMX.rdl file.  Also, please add a README to explain briefly what the report is and any 
dependencies or modifications another facility may need to make for their own environment.  Commenting of code is of 
course always helpful as well.
